# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

A good invariant would be "The array tmp contains the first i - 1 fibonacci numbers". 
This is a good invariant because it is true for every step of the recursion. At the 
beginning, the array conatains the first 2 fibonacci numbers and i is set to 2. "i" is 
then incremented by 1 and set to 3, so when the recursions starts, tmp has 2 fibonacci 
numbers making the statement true. Then the next fibonnaci number is calulated and 
added to the array, and the recusion continues. As this happens i is incremented by 1 
and the next fibonacci number is added to the array making the statement true again 
until the recusion is done.
